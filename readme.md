# Gasless DEX for ERC4337 as well as EOA

As the current DEXes don't supprot ERC4337 smart wallets on their dapp, it's difficult for users to swap tokens which are resting in their smart wallets
The current sccenario is to  build a transaction from your wallet which is not very user friendly for non-tech people. 

This dapp provides a very simmple interface which users can interact with and perform swaps gasless swaps with their smart wallets without needing to build a transaction. We are providing best swaps based on the data 
provided by 1inch. 

We are using safe auth kit and safe X Pimlico clients for the ERC4337 related transactions. 

We are also provifing multichain support with chains like, ethereun, polygon, Arbutrum, Scroll, Mantle.
